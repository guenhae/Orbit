For windows
1. Press "Start"-->"Run"; (or WinKey + R)
2. Run "cmd" command;
3. Change to grail\Debug folder with "cd destinationfolder" command;
4. Run "grail /fmmin 1.txt >2.txt" to minimize the DFA in 1.txt and put the result in 2.txt, or run "grail /fmunion 1.txt 2.txt >3.txt" to union the two DFAs in 1.txt and 2.txt then put the result in 3.txt.

This works for the functions we are currently using; however further testing has not been done for other functions.
